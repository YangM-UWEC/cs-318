        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This topic is about the lab3 and everything I have learned so far. I am still currently learning <br>
         how to do most things within the webpage creation. The amount of knowledge I have on creating <br>
         a webpage is little to none but I do have experince in coding so I have some experince in learning <br>
         new programs such as github and visual studio code. <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Experience so far</h3>
        <p>So far my experience with making these webpages are confusing. I am not really sure how to create <br>
        something to be more fitting for the normal person to see. I am currently learning how to add color and fonts<br>
        but am still behind in such aspect. I do enjoy using the program and creating such webpages in the class so far. <br>
        I hope that in the end I will be able to create such webpage without the struggle of having to continously<br>
        go back to look at my previous work.
