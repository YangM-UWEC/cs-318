        <h3>Importance of Meats</h3>
        <p>A healthy balanced diet can include protein from meat, as well as from fish and eggs or non-animal sources such as beans and
            <br> pulses. Meats such as chicken, pork, lamb and beef are all rich in protein.
            Red meat provides us with iron, zinc and B vitamins. <br>
            Meat is one of the main sources of vitamin B12 in the diet.</p>
