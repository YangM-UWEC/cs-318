            <p>Palindromes date back at least to 79 AD, as a palindrome was found as a graffito at Herculaneum, in a city buried by ash in that year.This 
            <br>palindrome, called Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: "Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas" ("The sower Arepo holds 
            <br>with effort the wheels"). It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word form the first word, the second letters form the 
            <br>second word, and so forth. Hence, it can be arranged into a word square that reads in four different ways: horizontally or vertically from 
            <br>either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. As such, they can be referred to as palindromatic.</p>

            <p>The palindromic Latin riddle "In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni" ("we go in a circle at night and are consumed by fire") describes 
            <br>the behavior of moths. It is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than ancient times. The second word, borrowed from Greek,
            <br> should properly be spelled gyrum.</p>
